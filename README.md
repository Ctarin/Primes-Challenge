Primes-Challenge
================

Obviously this is not well documented using git as it was an after thought for such a small project. When I found I had to make layers and how testing was going to work, my single file turned into multiples and only thendid I initiate a git repository. So bad manners on my part with regard to histories(I'm usually better). First attempt at unit and end testing, and using Rake to run ruby files. Also my first piece of code publicly available, I've a few more and maybe now I'll actually add them.
